## Description 📝

coco-resume is a versatile resume creation tool designed to maximize the amount of trust you can signal with your resume and cover letters

## Why? 🤔

In December 2023 I graduated in Computer Science to a cold, cold winter in jobland. The jobbies were not producing the jobs they used to.
I knew I needed to utilize the newest technologies to save as much time as possible and signal the most amount of trust.
