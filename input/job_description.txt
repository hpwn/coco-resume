 About the job
Join us on our mission to create a completely new, 100% digital bank that truly serves customers' best interests. We are a close-knit and fun-loving team of seasoned financial services professionals who came together for the challenge of building a bank from scratch - and we are committed to doing it all the right way (from technology infrastructure to modern marketing to customer experience).

The anticipated salary range for this role is between $78,000.00 and $145,000.00. The specific salary offered to an applicant will be based on their individual qualifications, experiences, and an analysis of the current compensation paid in their geography and the market for similar roles at the time of hire. The role may also be eligible for an annual discretionary incentive award. In addition to cash compensation, SMBC offers a competitive portfolio of benefits to its employees.

We work with the flexibility and speed of a start-up. But we also have significant stability and capital from being part of the SMBC Group (Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation). SMBC is the second largest bank in Japan and the 12th largest bank in the world with operations in over forty countries. And SMBC is committed to disrupting the US marketplace with ground-breaking products.

It is the best of both worlds, and we are seeking proven marketing leaders to propel us towards a national launch. We have both the ambitious growth plans and the 'patient capital' necessary to execute a multi-year plan. Join us on the journey to deliver an exciting concept of evolved banking.
